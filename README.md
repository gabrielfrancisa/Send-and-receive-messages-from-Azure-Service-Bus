# Send-and-receive-messages-from-Azure-Service-Bus
This project, I create and configure Azure Service Bus resources, then build a .NET app to send and receive messages using the Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus SDK. I learnt how to provision a Service Bus namespace and queue, assign permissions, and interact with messages programmatically.
